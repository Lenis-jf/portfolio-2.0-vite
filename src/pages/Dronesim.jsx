        <p>My first big Java project! ðŸš€ Developed for our OOP class, this GUI app taught me the magic of APIs and teamwork. We created different sections to display live drone data from a website provided by our university with search filters and calculated metrics like current battery consumption (yes, we did math for fun!).</p>

        <p>The catch? It only worked on campus WiFi! Though challenging, this project made me fall in love with problem-solving. Who knew connecting to an API could feel like cracking a secret code?</p>

        <p>Looking back, itâ€™s raw and beginner-friendlyâ€”exactly how learning should feel. My proudest moment? When our pagination function actually worked!</p>
